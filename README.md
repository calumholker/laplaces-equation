# Laplace's Equation
An  over-relaxation  method  is  used  to  numerically  solve  Laplaceâ€™s  equation  in  a  simple  case.   This is compared to the analytical solution and the values are found to all converge to the exact values.  The results further agree with the theory behind the over-relaxation parameter, agreeing on the optimum and maximum values.  This suggests that this method of approximation is accurate and can be used for more complex problems that cannot be solve analytically.
